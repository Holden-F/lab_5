# Computer Vision in Remote Sensing
## Coastal erosion and shoreline change detection

Computer Vision can use change detection on coastlines all around the world which is extremely important with storms and natural disasters becoming worse due to climate change. With this computer vision, we can detect what is changing the fastest and make a plan to mitigate such things.

Using Satellite data would be helpful for the global scale, but UAV data is better for small scale and high resolution data. The better the resolution, the better the computer is at detecting changes.

According to students at Harvard, the artificial neural network maps the shoreline change better than both k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine in the world of machine learning.
